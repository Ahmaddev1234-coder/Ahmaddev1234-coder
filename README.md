# About me
I build production-grade web applications and developer tools. My primary focus is on end-to-end solutions using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and modern React frameworks like **Next.js**. I enjoy designing APIs, optimizing performance, and shipping features that users love.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Personalized Mental Health Companion** (MERN + AI journaling assistant).  
- 🌱 Learning advanced serverless patterns and edge architectures with Next.js.  
- 👯 I’m open to collaboration on full-stack projects, particularly in e-commerce, developer tools, and AI-assisted products.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer code that's readable even after midnight debugging sessions.

# How I work — approach & values
1. **User-first**: Start with the problem, not the tech. Ship features that solve real needs.  
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, well-tested solutions over premature optimization.  
3. **Observability**: Logs, metrics, and error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket) help deliver stable apps.  
4. **Iteration**: Build a Minimum Viable Product, gather feedback, and iterate quickly.

# Quick tips to make this page even better
- Add live links and screenshots for each featured project (use `.github/` folder to host images).  
- Pin the repos you want visitors to see first.  
- Add a short demo GIF for 1–2 flagship projects (high conversion).  
- Keep the “Featured” project descriptions 1–2 sentences with tech stack and impact.

## Want me to:
- generate **project cards** with markdown + screenshots?  
- create the **portfolio landing page** HTML/Next.js template to match this README?  
If yes — I’ll generate the code and images placeholders next.
