# About me
I build production-grade web applications and developer tools. My primary focus is on end-to-end solutions using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and modern React frameworks like **Next.js**. I enjoy designing APIs, optimizing performance, and shipping features that users love.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a **Sports Website** (Nextjs and Nodejs).  
- ðŸŒ± Learning advanced serverless patterns and edge architectures with Next.js.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration on full-stack projects, particularly in e-commerce, developer tools, and AI-assisted products.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I prefer code that's readable even after midnight debugging sessions.
